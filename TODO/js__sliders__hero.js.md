# TODO

**Origin:** `js/sliders/hero.js` in `dbl-components`.
**Destination:** `js/sliders/hero.js` in `react-goat`.
**Existing TS:** No. A new TypeScript file needs to be created.
Translate the original file to TypeScript, maintaining the same API and behavior.
This file does not depend on Bootstrap, so it belongs in `react-goat`.
Add comprehensive TypeScript typings and typedoc. Keep all names and comments in English.
Write unit tests for the component, mocking all external dependencies (including any imports from `dbl-utils` or related files). Ensure that behavior matches the original JS implementation.
Document any props, state variables and events.
