**Origin:** Unknown. `types/goat.d.ts` exists in `react-goat` but there is no corresponding file in `dbl-components`.
**Destination:** `types/goat.d.ts` in `react-goat`.
Investigate the provenance of this file. Determine whether it is a new component not present in `dbl-components` or if the original file has been deleted/renamed.
Translate or update the file as needed, with full TypeScript typings, typedoc and unit tests.
